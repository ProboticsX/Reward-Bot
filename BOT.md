# Bot Implementation

## Bot Platform

We are using the ```Discord``` platform to implement our Reward bot. Also, we integrated the bot with GitHub to monitor the activities occuring on the Github repository (eg. commits, issues, comments, etc) and link it to our Discord platform. Hence, we were able to integrate the Github bot to our project as well with the use of some private key tokens shared between Discord and Github through Webhook.
