# Bot Implementation

### Bot Platform

We are using the Discord platform to implement our Reward bot. Also, we used the GitHub Webhook to monitor the activities occuring on the Github repository (eg. commits, issues, comments, etc) and link it to our Discord platform. We were able to create and integrate Discord bot to our project with the use of some private key tokens.
