### Limitations:
- The Reward bot provides static points to the users for doing commits irrespective of the length of the commit (+/-, additions/deletions) made by the user.
- The Reward bot provides static points to the users for closing issues irrespective of the priority of issue solved by the user.
- The GitHub use-cases of the bot is limited to few github actions only i.e. commits made and issues closed.

### Future Work:
- The Reward bot could judge the degree of commit made by the user. For eg. Dynamic points could be provided to the user according to the intensity of the commit made by the user.
- The Reward bot could judge the degree of issue closed by the user. For eg. Dynamic points could be provided to the user according to the priority of issue closed by the user.
- The Reward bot could assign badges to the user if they bag a certain level of points.
