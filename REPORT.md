### The problem your bot solved

We propose a bot that promotes positive reinforcement in collaborative projects involving multiple team members. Such a bot could be crucial especially in today's remote work environments, where people are unable to connect at an emotional level and tend to become demotivated when they are not rewarded for their collaborative efforts.

Our bot acts as a secondary reinforcer for actions such as answering GitHub issues, regular commits to a repository, and using positive words during conversations on Discord channels. Our bot aims to develop desirable stimuli among the users motivating them to collaborate more. The bot would provide channel statistics and self statistics features by monitoring the events on Discord channels and GitHub events. 

Students/colleagues are generally disinclined to come forward and assist their peers when collaboration is desired. A bot would be a good solution for overcoming the issue, since it's automatic with unbiased decision-making abilities would promote a healthy study/work environment. It would help in building a deeper personal connection with their team members. 


### Limitations:
- The Reward bot provides static points to the users for doing commits irrespective of the length of the commit (+/-, additions/deletions) made by the user.
- The Reward bot provides static points to the users for closing issues irrespective of the priority of issue solved by the user.
- The GitHub use-cases of the bot is limited to few github actions only i.e. commits made and issues closed.

### Future Work:
- The Reward bot could judge the degree of commit made by the user. For eg. Dynamic points could be provided to the user according to the intensity of the commit made by the user.
- The Reward bot could judge the degree of issue closed by the user. For eg. Dynamic points could be provided to the user according to the priority of issue closed by the user.
- The Reward bot could assign badges to the user if they bag a certain level of points.
